Project Name:SparkSave

Tagline:
An effective way to deal with problems on daily, weekly or monthly electricity supply and demand just with a few clicks and lots of AI.


The problem it solves:
How can AI enhance Electric Power Grid stability and reliability in the energy industry by enabling predictive analytics for demand forecasting?

 
SparkSave has brought an effective way to tackle this challenge.
 Here the user input by state which considers the data set of each state throughout the year for 3 years depending on which our Auto Arima Model predicts any future energy requirements in the recent future.
 The output page displays the graph of the estimated power supply required.

 
Thus, the basic goals of our app is:
 TO MINIMISE POWER SHORTAGE IN ALL PARTS OF THE COUNTRY, ESPECIALLY IN RURAL AREAS.
 TO MINIMISE COST AND PROVIDE AN EFFECTIVE MANAGEMENT OF POWER SYSTEMS.

 
We have acquired a dataset which consists of the power consumption of various units. Using this extensive dataset we are going to train a model with the help of various Python libraries like TensorFlow , Sci-Kit , Pandas and Numpy which will be able to forecast the energy prediction of these units for the upcoming time . This will help the power companies to be prepared for normal and for days when there might be a surge in usage for some special occasion.

Challenges we ran into:

Making the model and processing the data was a huge challenge for us.

 
We overcame this by reading online documents related to making Arima model and processing CSV files through python.
 The way we planned this out was really very challenging to achieve perfect results in two days. There would be some errors in responsiveness for the web application. However, we tried our best to make it successful.

 
For the website responsiveness, it should show some errors, as the CSS is highly pixelated. It should work well in laptop monitors.

 
The last part of the project was particularly challenging. We chose to stick to local host for our web application. However our model couldn't be deployed as we couldn't figure out how to deploy it in this short time. GitHub pages was showing some errors, which couldn't be rectified by us, unfortunately.

Technologies we used:
HTML
CSS
JavaScript
Python
